  Adjust "load", "unload", and "reload" commands to canonicalize
library names by simplifying paths and, for MS Windows, changing / to \.
For example, "a/b/../c/foo.dll" becomes "a/c/foo.dll" and "./foo.dll"
becomes "foo.dll" in _LIBS and the associated test for whether the
library is already loaded.  Nonetheless, "./foo.dll" is sought only in
the current directory, whereas "foo.dll" is sought in the directories
listed in $ampl_libpath.  It is still possible to load the same
library more than once by using a different name for it, either via a
hard or symbolic link, by using such variations as "foo.dll",
"foo_32.dll", "foo_64.dll", or using a name that starts with "../" or
otherwise involves enough instances of "/../" to take the apparent
name above the current directory.  Now _LIBS reflects the canonicalized
names, and possibly simplified full pathnames appear in $AMPLFUNC.
  Fix some glitches under MS Windows that, depending on the compiler
used, could lead to a "Cannot find" rather than a "Cannot load" error
message.
